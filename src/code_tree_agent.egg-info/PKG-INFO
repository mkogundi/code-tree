# Code Tree Agent

LangGraph-based agent that generates a detailed, machine-readable code tree artifact for a codebase and serves it through a Streamlit UI for human exploration.

## Features

- Automated file discovery with configurable language coverage.
- Static analysis of Python modules with docstring capture.
- Heuristic symbol and dependency extraction for Java and JavaScript/TypeScript (including JSX/TSX components).
- Dependency graph construction with intra-repository resolution heuristics.
- Artifact export as JSON for consumption by other coding agents.
- Streamlit dashboard to inspect file summaries, dependencies, and symbol hierarchies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Optional: OpenAI or other LLM credentials if you extend the graph with LLM-backed nodes.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
code-tree-agent --target PATH_TO_REPO --output artifacts/code_tree.json
```

The `--target` flag defaults to the current directory, so you can omit it to analyze the active workspace. The command produces a JSON artifact that includes per-file structural metadata (Python, Java, and JS/TS/JSX symbols) and a dependency graph. By default the output is placed at `artifacts/code_tree.json`.

## Streamlit UI

```bash
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

Use the sidebar to point the UI at the latest artifact (defaults to `artifacts/code_tree.json`).

## Project Structure

- `src/code_tree_agent/graph.py`: LangGraph pipeline wiring.
- `src/code_tree_agent/nodes/`: Individual graph nodes for discovery, analysis, dependency resolution, and artifact emission.
- `ui/app.py`: Streamlit interface for visualization.
- `artifacts/`: Default location for generated artifacts.

## Extending the Agent

1. Add new nodes under `src/code_tree_agent/nodes/` to incorporate additional analyses.
2. Register the nodes in `graph.py` to extend the pipeline.
3. Update the Streamlit UI to surface new artifact fields as needed.

## Testing

Run the static checks with:

```bash
pytest
```
